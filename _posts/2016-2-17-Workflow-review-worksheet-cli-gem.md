title: Workflow Review Worksheets&#58; CLI Gem!
---

When I studied in college I used to make one page review worksheets for most of my science classes. Then I would refer back to them every once in a while to keep concepts and workflows fresh in my mind. So I thought it would be cool to continue this form of review with all dev topics, and there is a chance that they might come in handy for other students as well, so I will be posting more of these worksheets soon.


This is a general outline of the workflow I used when making my gem [Broadway Now](https://github.com/lcorr8/broadway-now-cli-gem).

**Disclaimer:** I didn't include all the steps involved for this project. I only included enough to give me a general idea of how to complete a task in the future when I do my review. So please do not get lazy and use this as your only guide if you are trying to figure out how to do this assignment.

Feel free to use/share this review if you find it useful :)
