Today I spent the day teaching myself to make a blog in  anticipation of my Ruby Gem project. I attempted a more complex set up which completely defeated me halfway through, sadly. However while looking for answers I came across this beautiful [how-to guide by Barry Clark](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) for a simple blog using Jekyll and Github. It is perfect for newbies like myself as it is amazingly detailed. Additionally I loved the minimalist theme. You can find the instructions and the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub, as well as Adam Pritchard's [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing posts.
